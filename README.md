I'm interested in developing end-user experiences. Now I'm focused on developing iOS (SwiftUI) mobile applications.

My stydies of this terchnology are based on [Stanford University's CS193p (Developing Applications for iOS using SwiftUI)](https://cs193p.sites.stanford.edu/) cource.
Two apps developed through this cource can be found [here](https://github.com/vasilevsky007/Cardgame) and [here](https://github.com/vasilevsky007/EmojiArt)

My real-life (-ish) food delivery app pet project can be found [here](https://github.com/vasilevsky007/Shawa)

Also I've done some lab works in the univercity using Swift for MacOS, they can be found [here](https://github.com/vasilevsky007/SwiftLabs7Term)
